1.	Which of these about a set is not true?
a)	Mutable data type
b)	Does not allow duplicate values
c)	Data type with unordered values
d)	Immutable data type


Answer: d
Explanation: A set is a mutable data type with non-duplicate, unordered values, providing the usual mathematical set operations. 



2.	Which of the following is not the correct syntax for creating a set?
a)	set([[1,2],[3,4]])
b)	set([1,2,2,3,4])
c)	set((1,2,3,4))
d)	{1,2,3,4}


Answer: a
Explanation: The argument given for the set must be an iterable.



(Python Sets – 1) 3.	What will be the output of the following Python code?

nums = set([1,1,2,3,3,3,4,4])
print(len(nums))

a)	7
b)	Error, invalid syntax for formation of set
c)	4
d)	8


Answer: c
Explanation:  A set doesn’t have duplicate items. 



(Python Sets – 1) 4.  What will be the output of the following Python code?

a = [5,5,6,7,7,7]
b = set(a)
def test(lst):
    if lst in b:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0
for i in  filter(test, a):
    print(i,end=" ")

a)	5 5 6
b)	5 6 7
c)	5 5 6 7 7 7
d)	5 6 7 7 7


Answer: c
Explanation: The filter function will return all the values from list a which are true when passed to function test. Since all the members of the set are non-duplicate members of the list, all of the values will return true. Hence all the values in the list are printed.



5.	Which of the following statements is used to create an empty set?
a)	{ }
b)	set()
c)	[ ] 
d)	( )


Answer: b
Explanation: { } creates a dictionary not a set. Only set() creates an empty set. 



(Python Sets – 1) 6.	What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> a={5,4}
>>> b={1,2,4,5}
>>> a<b

a)	{1,2}
b)	True
c)	False
d)	Invalid operation


Answer: b
Explanation: a<b returns True if a is a proper subset of b.



7.  If a={5,6,7,8}, which of the following statements is false?
a)	print(len(a))
b)	print(min(a))
c)	a.remove(5)
d)	a[2]=45


Answer: d
Explanation: The members of a set can be accessed by their index values since the elements of the set are unordered.



8.  If a={5,6,7}, what happens when a.add(5) is executed?
a)	a={5,5,6,7}
b)	a={5,6,7}
c)	Error as there is no add function for set data type
d)	Error as 5 already exists in the set


Answer: b
Explanation: There exists add method for set data type. However 5 isn’t added again as set consists of only non-duplicate elements and 5 already exists in the set. Execute in python shell to verify.



(Python Sets – 1) 9.  What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> a={4,5,6}
>>> b={2,8,6}
>>> a+b

a)	{4,5,6,2,8}
b)	{4,5,6,2,8,6}
c)	Error as unsupported operand type for sets
d)	Error as the duplicate item 6 is present in both sets


Answer: c
Explanation: Execute in python shell to verify.



(Python Sets – 1) 10.  What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> a={4,5,6}
>>> b={2,8,6}
>>> a-b

a)	{4,5}
b)	{6}
c)	Error as unsupported operand type for set data type
d)	Error as the duplicate item 6 is present in both sets


Answer: a
Explanation: – operator gives the set of elements in set a but not in set b. 



(Python Sets – 1) 11.	What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> a={5,6,7,8}
>>> b={7,8,10,11}
>>> a^b

a)	{5,6,7,8,10,11}
b)	{7,8}
c)	Error as unsupported operand type of set data type
d)	{5,6,10,11}


Answer: d
Explanation: ^ operator returns a set of elements in set A or set B, but not in both (symmetric difference). 



(Python Sets – 1) 12. What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> s={5,6}
>>> s*3

a)	Error as unsupported operand type for set data type
b)	{5,6,5,6,5,6}
c)	{5,6}
d)	Error as multiplication creates duplicate elements which isn’t allowed


Answer: a
Explanation: The multiplication operator isn’t valid for the set data type.



(Python Sets – 1) 13. What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> a={5,6,7,8}
>>> b={7,5,6,8}
>>> a==b

a)	True
b)	False


Answer: a
Explanation:  It is possible to compare two sets and the order of elements in both the sets doesn’t matter if the values of the elements are the same.



(Python Sets – 1) 14. What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> a={3,4,5}
>>> b={5,6,7}
>>> a|b

a)	Invalid operation
b)	{3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
c)	{5}
d)	{3,4,6,7}


Answer: b
Explanation:  The operation in the above piece of code is union operation. This operation produces a set of elements in both set a and set b.



(Python Sets – 1) 15. Is the following Python code valid?

a={3,4,{7,5}}
print(a[2][0])

a)	Yes, 7 is printed
b)	Error, elements of a set can’t be printed
c)	Error, subsets aren’t allowed
d)	Yes, {7,5} is printed


Answer: c
Explanation: In python, elements of a set must not be mutable and sets are mutable. Thus, subsets can’t exist.
