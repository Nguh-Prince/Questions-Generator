(Python Precedence and Associativity-2) 1. What will be the output of the following Python expression?

print(4.00/(2.0+2.0))

a) Error
b) 1.0
c) 1.00
d) 1


Answer: b
Explanation: The result of the expression shown above is 1.0 because print rounds off digits.



(Python Precedence and Associativity-2) 2. What will be the value of X in the following Python expression?

X = 2+9*((3*12)-8)/10

a) 30.0
b) 30.8
c) 28.4
d) 27.2


Answer: d
Explanation: The expression shown above is evaluated as: 2+9*(36-8)/10, which simplifies to give 2+9*(2.8), which is equal to 2+25.2 = 27.2. Hence the result of this expression is 27.2.



3. Which of the following expressions involves coercion when evaluated in Python?
a) 4.7 – 1.5
b) 7.9 * 6.3
c) 1.7 % 2
d) 3.4 + 4.6


Answer: c
Explanation: Coercion is the implicit (automatic) conversion of operands to a common type. Coercion is automatically performed on mixed-type expressions. The expression 1.7 % 2 is evaluated as 1.7 % 2.0 (that is, automatic conversion of int to float).



(Python Precedence and Associativity-2) 4. What will be the output of the following Python expression?

24//6%3, 24//4//2

a) (1,3)
b) (0,3)
c) (1,0)
d) (3,1)


Answer: a
Explanation: The expressions are evaluated as: 4%3 and 6//2 respectively. This results in the answer (1,3). This is because the associativity of both of the expressions shown above is left to right.



(Python Precedence and Associativity-2) 5. Which among the following list of operators has the highest precedence?

 +, -, **, %, /, <<, >>, |

a) <<, >>
b) **
c) |
d) %


Answer: b
Explanation: The highest precedence is that of the exponentiation operator, that is of **.



(Python Precedence and Associativity-2) 6. What will be the value of the following Python expression?

float(4+int(2.39)%2)

a) 5.0
b) 5
c) 4.0
d) 4


Answer: c
Explanation: The above expression is an example of explicit conversion. It is evaluated as: float(4+int(2.39)%2) = float(4+2%2) = float(4+0) = 4.0. Hence the result of this expression is 4.0.



7. Which of the following expressions is an example of type conversion?
a) 4.0 + float(3)
b) 5.3 + 6.3
c) 5.0 + 3
d) 3 + 7


Answer: a
Explanation: Type conversion is nothing but explicit conversion of operands to a specific type. Options 5.3 + 6.3 and 5.0 + 3 are examples of implicit conversion whereas option 4.0 + float(3) is an example of explicit conversion or type conversion.



8. Which of the following expressions results in an error?
a) float(‘10’)
b) int(‘10’)
c) float(’10.8’)
d) int(’10.8’)


Answer: d
Explanation: All of the above examples show explicit conversion. However the expression int(’10.8’) results in an error.



(Python Precedence and Associativity-2) 9. What will be the value of the following Python expression?

4+2**5//10

a) 3
b) 7
c) 77
d) 0


Answer: b
Explanation: The order of precedence is: **, //, +. The expression 4+2**5//10 is evaluated as 4+32//10, which is equal to 4+3 = 7. Hence the result of the expression shown above is 7.



10. The expression 2**2**3 is evaluates as: (2**2)**3.
a) True
b) False


Answer: b
Explanation: The value of the expression (2**2)**3 = 4**3 = 64. When the expression 2**2**3 is evaluated in python, we get the result as 256, because this expression is evaluated as 2**(2**3). This is because the associativity of exponentiation operator (**) is from right to left and not from left to right.
