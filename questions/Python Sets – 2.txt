1.	Which of these about a frozenset is not true?
a)	Mutable data type
b)	Allows duplicate values
c)	Data type with unordered values
d)	Immutable data type


Answer: a
Explanation: A frozenset is an immutable data type.



(Python Sets – 2) 2.	What is the syntax of the following Python code?

>>> a=frozenset(set([5,6,7]))
>>> a

a)	{5,6,7}
b)	frozenset({5,6,7})
c)	Error, not possible to convert set into frozenset
d)	Syntax error


Answer: b
Explanation: The above piece of code is the correct syntax for creating a frozenset.



(Python Sets – 2) 3.	Is the following Python code valid?

>>> a=frozenset([5,6,7])
>>> a
>>> a.add(5)

a)	Yes, now a is {5,5,6,7}
b)	No, frozen set is immutable
c)	No, invalid syntax for add method
d)	Yes, now a is {5,6,7}


Answer: b
Explanation:  Since a frozen set is immutable, add method doesn’t exist for frozen method.



4.  Set members must not be hashable.
a)	True
b)	False


Answer: b
Explanation: Set members must always be hashable.



(Python Sets – 2) 5. What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> a={3,4,5}
>>> a.update([1,2,3])
>>> a

a)	Error, no method called update for set data type
b)	{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
c)	Error, list can’t be added to set
d)	Error, duplicate item present in list


Answer: b
Explanation: The method update adds elements to a set.



(Python Sets – 2) 6. What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> a={1,2,3}
>>> a.intersection_update({2,3,4,5})
>>> a

a)	{2,3}
b)	Error, duplicate item present in list
c)	Error, no method called intersection_update for set data type
d)	{1,4,5}


Answer: a
Explanation: The method intersection_update returns a set which is an intersection of both the sets.



(Python Sets – 2) 7. What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> a={1,2,3}
>>> b=a
>>> b.remove(3)
>>> a

a)	{1,2,3}
b)	Error, copying of sets isn’t allowed
c)	{1,2}
d)	Error, invalid syntax for remove


Answer: c
Explanation: Any change made in b is reflected in a because b is an alias of a.



(Python Sets – 2) 8. What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> a={1,2,3}
>>> b=a.copy()
>>> b.add(4)
>>> a

a)	{1,2,3}
b)	Error, invalid syntax for add
c)	{1,2,3,4}
d)	Error, copying of sets isn’t allowed


Answer: a
Explanation: In the above piece of code, b is barely a copy and not an alias of a. Hence any change made in b isn’t reflected in a.



(Python Sets – 2) 9. What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> a={1,2,3}
>>> b=a.add(4)
>>> b

a)	0
b)	{1,2,3,4}
c)	{1,2,3}
d)	Nothing is printed


Answer: d
Explanation: The method add returns nothing, hence nothing is printed.



(Python Sets – 2) 10. What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> a={1,2,3}
>>> b=frozenset([3,4,5])
>>> a-b

a)	{1,2}
b)	Error as difference between a set and frozenset can’t be found out
c)	Error as unsupported operand type for set data type
d)	frozenset({1,2})


Answer: a
Explanation: – operator gives the set of elements in set a but not in set b.



(Python Sets – 2) 11. What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> a={5,6,7}
>>> sum(a,5)

a)	5
b)	23
c)	18
d)	Invalid syntax for sum method, too many arguments


Answer: b
Explanation: The second parameter is the start value for the sum of elements in set a. Thus, sum(a,5) = 5+(5+6+7)=23.



(Python Sets – 2) 12. What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> a={1,2,3}
>>> {x*2 for x in a|{4,5}}

a)	{2,4,6}
b)	Error, set comprehensions aren’t allowed
c)	{8, 2, 10, 4, 6}
d)	{8,10}


Answer: c
Explanation: Set comprehensions are allowed.



(Python Sets – 2) 13. What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> a={5,6,7,8}
>>> b={7,8,9,10}
>>> len(a+b)

a)	8
b)	Error, unsupported operand ‘+’ for sets
c)	6
d)	Nothing is displayed


Answer: b
Explanation:  Duplicate elements in a+b is eliminated and the length of a+b is computed.



(Python Sets – 2) 14. What will be the output of the following Python code?

a={1,2,3}
b={1,2,3}
c=a.issubset(b)
print(c)

a)	True
b)	Error, no method called issubset() exists
c)	Syntax error for issubset() method
d)	False


Answer: a
Explanation:  The method issubset() returns True if b is a proper subset of a.



(Python Sets – 2) 15. Is the following Python code valid?

a={1,2,3}
b={1,2,3,4}
c=a.issuperset(b)
print(c)

a)	False
b)	True
c)	Syntax error for issuperset() method
d)	Error, no method called issuperset() exists


Answer: a
Explanation:  The method issubset() returns True if b is a proper subset of a.
