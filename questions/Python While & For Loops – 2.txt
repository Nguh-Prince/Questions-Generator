(Python While & For Loops – 2) 3. What will be the output of the following Python code?

x = "abcdef"
while i in x:
    print(i, end=" ")

a) a b c d e f
b) abcdef
c) i i i i i i …

Answer: d
Explanation: NameError, i is not defined.



(Python While & For Loops – 2) 4. What will be the output of the following Python code?

x = "abcdef"
i = "i"
while i in x:
    print(i, end=" ")

a) no output
b) i i i i i i …
c) a b c d e f
d) abcdef


Answer: a
Explanation: “i” is not in “abcdef”.



(Python While & For Loops – 2) 5. What will be the output of the following Python code?

x = "abcdef"
i = "a"
while i in x:
    print(i, end = " ")

a) no output
b) i i i i i i …
c) a a a a a a …
d) a b c d e f


Answer: c
Explanation: As the value of i or x isn’t changing, the condition will always evaluate to True.



(Python While & For Loops – 2) 6. What will be the output of the following Python code?

x = "abcdef"
i = "a"
while i in x:
    print('i', end = " ")

a) no output
b) i i i i i i …
c) a a a a a a …
d) a b c d e f


Answer: b
Explanation: Here i i i i i … printed continuously because as the value of i or x isn’t changing, the condition will always evaluate to True. But also here we use a citation marks on “i”, so, here i treated as a string, not like a variable.



(Python While & For Loops – 2) 7. What will be the output of the following Python code?

x = "abcdef"
i = "a"
while i in x:
    x = x[:-1]
    print(i, end = " ")

a) i i i i i i
b) a a a a a a
c) a a a a a
d) none of the mentioned


Answer: b
Explanation: The string x is being shortened by one character in each iteration.

while i in x[:-1]:
    print(i, end = " ")

a) a a a a a
b) a a a a a a
c) a a a a a a …
d) a


Answer: c
Explanation: String x is not being altered and i is in x[:-1].
