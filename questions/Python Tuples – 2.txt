1.	What is the data type of (1)?
a)	Tuple
b)	Integer
c)	List
d)	Both tuple and integer


Answer: b
Explanation: A tuple of one element must be created as (1,).



2.	If a=(1,2,3,4), a[1:-1] is _________
a)	Error, tuple slicing doesn’t exist
b)	[2,3] 
c)	(2,3,4)
d)	(2,3)


Answer: d
Explanation: Tuple slicing exists and a[1:-1] returns (2,3).



(Python Tuples – 2) 3.	What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> a=(1,2,(4,5))
>>> b=(1,2,(3,4))
>>> a<b

a)	False
b)	True
c)	Error, < operator is not valid for tuples
d)	Error, < operator is valid for tuples but not if there are sub-tuples


Answer: a
Explanation: Since the first element in the sub-tuple of a is larger that the first element in the subtuple of b, False is printed.



(Python Tuples – 2) 4.	What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> a=("Check")*3
>>> a

a)  (‘Check’,’Check’,’Check’)
b) * Operator not valid for tuples
c)  (‘CheckCheckCheck’)
d) Syntax error


Answer: c
Explanation: Here (“Check”) is a string not a tuple because there is no comma after the element.



(Python Tuples – 2) 5.	What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> a=(1,2,3,4)
>>> del(a[2])

a)	Now, a=(1,2,4)
b)	Now, a=(1,3,4)
c)	Now a=(3,4)
d)	Error as tuple is immutable


Answer: d
Explanation: ‘tuple’ object doesn’t support item deletion.



(Python Tuples – 2) 6.	What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> a=(2,3,4)
>>> sum(a,3)

a)	Too many arguments for sum() method
b)	The method sum() doesn’t exist for tuples
c)	12
d)	9


Answer: c
Explanation: In the above case, 3 is the starting value to which the sum of the tuple is added to.



(Python Tuples – 2) 7.	Is the following Python code valid?

>>> a=(1,2,3,4)
>>> del a

a)	No because tuple is immutable
b)	Yes, first element in the tuple is deleted
c)	Yes, the entire tuple is deleted
d)	No, invalid syntax for del method


Answer: c
Explanation: The command del a deletes the entire tuple.



8.	What type of data is: a=[(1,1),(2,4),(3,9)]?
a)	Array of tuples
b)	List of tuples
c)	Tuples of lists
d)	Invalid type


Answer: b
Explanation: The variable a has tuples enclosed in a list making it a list of tuples.



(Python Tuples – 2) 9.	What will be the output of the following Python code?

>>> a=(0,1,2,3,4)
>>> b=slice(0,2)
>>> a[b]

a)	Invalid syntax for slicing
b)	[0,2] 
c)	(0,1)
d)	(0,2)


Answer: c
Explanation: The method illustrated in the above piece of code is that of naming of slices.



(Python Tuples – 2) 10.	Is the following Python code valid?

>>> a=(1,2,3)
>>> b=('A','B','C')
>>> c=tuple(zip(a,b))

a)	Yes, c will be ((1, ‘A’), (2, ‘B’), (3, ‘C’))
b)	Yes, c will be ((1,2,3),(‘A’,’B’,’C’))
c)	No because tuples are immutable
d)	No because the syntax for zip function isn’t valid


Answer: a
Explanation: Zip function combines individual elements of two iterables into tuples. Execute in Python shell to verify.
