"john" in d

a) True
b) False
c) None

a) 40
b) 45
c) “john”
d) “peter”


 Answer: a
Explanation: Execute in the shell to verify. 



7. Suppose d = {“john”:40, “peter”:45}, to delete the entry for “john” what command do we use?
a) d.delete(“john”:40)
b) d.delete(“john”)
c) del d[“john”] 
d) del d(“john”:40)


 Answer: c
Explanation: Execute in the shell to verify.



8. Suppose d = {“john”:40, “peter”:45}. To obtain the number of entries in dictionary which command do we use?
a) d.size()
b) len(d)
c) size(d)
d) d.len()


 Answer: b

(Python Dictionary – 1) 9. What will be the output of the following Python code snippet?

d1 == d2

a) [“john”, “peter”] 
b) [“john”:40, “peter”:45] 
c) (“john”, “peter”)
d) (“john”:40, “peter”:45)


 Answer: a
Explanation: The output of the code shown above is a list containing only keys of the dictionary d, in the form of a list.



10. Suppose d = {“john”:40, “peter”:45}, what happens when we try to retrieve a value using the expression d[“susan”]?
a) Since “susan” is not a value in the set, Python raises a KeyError exception
b) It is executed fine and no exception is raised, and it returns None
c) Since “susan” is not a key in the set, Python raises a KeyError exception
d) Since “susan” is not a key in the set, Python raises a syntax error


 Answer: c
Explanation: Execute in the shell to verify.
