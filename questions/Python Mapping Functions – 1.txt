(Python Mapping Functions – 1) 1. What will be the output of the following Python code?

elements = [0, 1, 2]
def incr(x):
    return x+1
print(list(map(elements, incr)))

a) [1, 2, 3] 
b) [0, 1, 2] 
c) error
d) none of the mentioned


Answer: c
Explanation: The list should be the second parameter to the mapping function.



(Python Mapping Functions – 1) 2. What will be the output of the following Python code?

elements = [0, 1, 2]
def incr(x):
    return x+1
print(list(map(incr, elements)))

a) [1, 2, 3] 
b) [0, 1, 2] 
c) error
d) none of the mentioned


Answer: a
Explanation: Each element of the list is incremented.



(Python Mapping Functions – 1) 3. What will be the output of the following Python code?

x = ['ab', 'cd']
print(list(map(upper, x)))

a) [‘AB’, ‘CD’] 
b) [‘ab’, ‘cd’] 
c) error
d) none of the mentioned


Answer: c
Explanation: A NameError occurs because upper is a class method.



(Python Mapping Functions – 1) 4. What will be the output of the following Python code?

def to_upper(k):
    return k.upper()
x = ['ab', 'cd']
print(list(map(upper, x)))

a) [‘AB’, ‘CD’] 
b) [‘ab’, ‘cd’] 
c) none of the mentioned
d) error


Answer: d
Explanation: A NameError occurs because upper is a class method.



(Python Mapping Functions – 1) 5. What will be the output of the following Python code?

def to_upper(k):
    return k.upper()
x = ['ab', 'cd']
print(list(map(to_upper, x)))

a) [‘AB’, ‘CD’] 
b) [‘ab’, ‘cd’] 
c) none of the mentioned
d) error


Answer: a
Explanation: Each element of the list is converted to uppercase.



(Python Mapping Functions – 1) 6. What will be the output of the following Python code?

def to_upper(k):
    k.upper()
x = ['ab', 'cd']
print(list(map(to_upper, x)))

a) [‘AB’, ‘CD’] 
b) [‘ab’, ‘cd’] 
c) none of the mentioned
d) error


Answer: c
Explanation: A list of Nones is printed as to_upper() returns None.



(Python Mapping Functions – 1) 7. What will be the output of the following Python code?

x = ['ab', 'cd']
print(map(len, x))

a) [‘ab’, ‘cd’] 
b) [2, 2] 
c) [‘2’, ‘2’] 
d) none of the mentioned


Answer: d
Explanation: A map object is generated by map(). We must convert this to a list to be able to print it in a human readable form.



(Python Mapping Functions – 1) 8. What will be the output of the following Python code?

x = ['ab', 'cd']
print(list(map(len, x)))

a) [‘ab’, ‘cd’] 
b) [2, 2] 
c) [‘2’, ‘2’] 
d) none of the mentioned


Answer: b
Explanation: The length of each string is 2.



(Python Mapping Functions – 1) 9. What will be the output of the following Python code?

x = ['ab', 'cd']
print(len(map(list, x)))

a) [2, 2] 
b) 2
c) 4
d) none of the mentioned


Answer: d
Explanation: A TypeError occurs as map has no len().



(Python Mapping Functions – 1) 10. What will be the output of the following Python code?

x = ['ab', 'cd']
print(len(list(map(list, x))))

a) 2
b) 4
c) error
d) none of the mentioned
