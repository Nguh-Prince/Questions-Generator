1.	What is a variable defined outside a function referred to as?
a)	A static variable
b)	A global variable
c)	A local variable
d)	An automatic variable


Answer: b
Explanation: The value of a variable defined outside all function definitions is referred to as a global variable and can be used by multiple functions of the program.



2.	What is a variable defined inside a function referred to as?
a)	A global variable
b)	A volatile variable
c)	A local variable
d)	An automatic variable


Answer: c
Explanation: The variable inside a function is called as local variable and the variable definition is confined only to that function.



(Python Function – 4) 3.	What will be the output of the following Python code?

i=0
def change(i):
   i=i+1
   return i
change(1)
print(i)

a)	1
b)	Nothing is displayed
c)	0
d)	An exception is thrown


Answer: c
Explanation: Any change made in to an immutable data type in a function isn’t reflected outside the function.



(Python Function – 4) 4.	What will be the output of the following Python code?

def a(b):
    b = b + [5]
 
c = [1, 2, 3, 4]
a(c)
print(len(c))

a)	4
b)	5
c)	1
d)	An exception is thrown


Answer: a
Explanation: Since a list is mutable, any change made in the list in the function is reflected outside the function.



(Python Function – 4) 5.	What will be the output of the following Python code?

a=10
b=20
def change():
    global b
    a=45
    b=56
change()
print(a)
print(b)

a)

Answer: a
Explanation: The statement “global b” allows the global value of b to be accessed and changed. Whereas the variable a is local and hence the change isn’t reflected outside the function.



(Python Function – 4) 6.  What will be the output of the following Python code?

def change(i = 1, j = 2):
    i = i + j
    j = j + 1
    print(i, j)
change(j = 1, i = 2)

a)	An exception is thrown because of conflicting values
b)	1 2
c)	3 3
d)	3 2


Answer: d
Explanation: The values given during function call is taken into consideration, that is, i=2 and j=1.



(Python Function – 4) 7.	What will be the output of the following Python code?

def change(one, *two):
   print(type(two))
change(1,2,3,4)

a)	Integer
b)	Tuple
c)	Dictionary
d)	An exception is thrown


Answer: b
Explanation: The parameter two is a variable parameter and consists of (2,3,4). Hence the data type is tuple.



8.  If a function doesn’t have a return statement, which of the following does the function return?
a)	int
b)	null
c)	None
d)	An exception is thrown without the return statement


Answer: c
Explanation: A function can exist without a return statement and returns None if the function doesn’t have a return statement.



(Python Function – 4) 9.  What will be the output of the following Python code?

def display(b, n):
    while n > 0:
        print(b,end="")
        n=n-1
display('z',3)

a)	zzz
b)	zz
c)	An exception is executed
d)	Infinite loop


Answer: a
Explanation: The loop runs three times and ‘z’ is printed each time.



(Python Function – 4) 10. What will be the output of the following Python code?

def find(a, **b):
   print(type(b))
find('letters',A='1',B='2')

a)	String
b)	Tuple
c)	Dictionary
d)	An exception is thrown


Answer: c
Explanation: b combines the remaining parameters into a dictionary.
