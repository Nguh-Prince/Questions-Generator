(Python Global vs Local Variables – 1) 1. What will be the output of the following Python code?

def f1():
    x=15
    print(x)
x=12
f1()

a) Error
b) 12
c) 15
d) 1512


Answer: c
Explanation: In the code shown above, x=15 is a local variable whereas x=12 is a global variable. Preference is given to local variable over global variable. Hence the output of the code shown above is 15.



(Python Global vs Local Variables – 1) 2. What will be the output of the following Python code?

def f1():
    x=100
    print(x)
x=+1
f1()

a) Error
b) 100
c) 101
d) 99


Answer: b
Explanation: The variable x is a local variable. It is first printed and then modified. Hence the output of this code is 100.



(Python Global vs Local Variables – 1) 3. What will be the output of the following Python code?

def san(x):
    print(x+1)
x=-2
x=4
san(12)

a) 13
b) 10
c) 2
d) 5


Answer: a
Explanation: The value passed to the function san() is 12. This value is incremented by one and printed. Hence the output of the code shown above is 13.



(Python Global vs Local Variables – 1) 4. What will be the output of the following Python code?

def f1():
    global x
    x+=1
    print(x)
x=12
print("x")

a) Error
b) 13
c)

Answer: d
Explanation: In the code shown above, the variable ‘x’ is declared as global within the function. Hence the output is ‘x’. Had the variable ‘x’ been a local variable, the output would have been:
13
x



(Python Global vs Local Variables – 1) 5. What will be the output of the following Python code?

def f1(x):
    global x
    x+=1
    print(x)
f1(15)
print("hello")

a) error
b) hello
c) 16
d)

Answer: a
Explanation: The code shown above will result in an error because ‘x’ is a global variable. Had it been a local variable, the output would be: 16
    hello



(Python Global vs Local Variables – 1) 6. What will be the output of the following Python code?

x=12
def f1(a,b=x):
    print(a,b)
x=15
f1(4)

a) Error
b) 12 4
c) 4 12
d) 4 15


Answer: c
Explanation: At the time of leader processing, the value of ‘x’ is 12. It is not modified later. The value passed to the function f1 is 4. Hence the output of the code shown above is 4 12.



(Python Global vs Local Variables – 1) 7. What will be the output of the following Python code?

def f():
    global a
    print(a)
    a = "hello"
    print(a) 
a = "world" 
f()
print(a)

a)

Answer: b
Explanation: Since the variable ‘a’ has been explicitly specified as a global variable, the value of a passed to the function is ‘world’. Hence the output of this code is:
world
hello
hello



(Python Global vs Local Variables – 1) 8. What will be the output of the following Python code?

def f1(a,b=[]):
    b.append(a)
    return b
print(f1(2,[3,4]))

a) [3,2,4]
b) [2,3,4]
c) Error
d) [3,4,2]


Answer: d
Explanation: In the code shown above, the integer 2 is appended to the list [3,4]. Hence the output of the code is [3,4,2]. Both the variables a and b are local variables.



(Python Global vs Local Variables – 1) 9. What will be the output of the following Python code?

def f(p, q, r):
    global s
    p = 10
    q = 20
    r = 30
    s = 40
    print(p,q,r,s)
p,q,r,s = 1,2,3,4
f(5,10,15)

a) 1 2 3 4
b) 5 10 15 4
c) 10 20 30 40
d) 5 10 15 40


Answer: c
Explanation: The above code shows a combination of local and global variables. The output of this code is: 10 20 30 40



(Python Global vs Local Variables – 1) 10. What will be the output of the following Python code?

def f(x):
    print("outer")
    def f1(a):
        print("inner")
        print(a,x)
f(3)
f1(1)

a)

Answer: a
Explanation: The error will be caused due to the statement f1(1) because the function is nested. If f1(1) had been called inside the function, the output would have been different and there would be no error.



(Python Global vs Local Variables – 1) 11. What will be the output of the following Python code?

x = 5 
def f1():
    global x
    x = 4
def f2(a,b):
    global x
    return a+b+x
f1()
total = f2(1,2)
print(total)

a) Error
b) 7
c) 8
d) 15


Answer: b
Explanation: In the code shown above, the variable ‘x’ has been declared as a global variable under both the functions f1 and f2. The value returned is a+b+x = 1+2+4 = 7.



(Python Global vs Local Variables – 1) 12. What will be the output of the following Python code?

x=100
def f1():
    global x
    x=90
def f2():
    global x
    x=80
print(x)

a) 100
b) 90
c) 80
d) Error


Answer: a
Explanation: The output of the code shown above is 100. This is because the variable ‘x’ has been declared as global within the functions f1 and f2.



(Python Global vs Local Variables – 1) 13. Read the following Python code carefully and point out the global variables?

y, z = 1, 2
def f():
    global x
    x = y+z

a) x
b) y and z
c) x, y and z
d) Neither x, nor y, nor z


Answer: c
Explanation: In the code shown above, x, y and z are global variables inside the function f. y and z are global because they are not assigned in the function. x is a global variable because it is explicitly specified so in the code. Hence, x, y and z are global variables.
