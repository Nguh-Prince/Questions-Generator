1. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called __________
a) lambda
b) pi
c) anonymous
d) none of the mentioned


 Answer: a
Explanation: Python supports the creation of anonymous functions (i.e. functions that are not bound to a name) at runtime, using a construct called lambda. Lambda functions are restricted to a single expression. They can be used wherever normal functions can be used. 



(Python Function – 3) 2. What will be the output of the following Python code?

y = 6

a) 48
b) 14
c) 64
d) None of the mentioned


 Answer: a
Explanation: The lambda keyword creates an anonymous function. The x is a parameter, that is passed to the lambda function. The parameter is followed by a colon character. The code next to the colon is the expression that is executed, when the lambda function is called. The lambda function is assigned to the z variable.
The lambda function is executed. The number 8 is passed to the anonymous function and it returns 48 as the result. Note that z is not a name for this function. It is only a variable to which the anonymous function was assigned.

z = lambda x: x * y

a) 15
b) 555
c) 125
d) None of the mentioned


 Answer: c
Explanation: None. 



4. Does Lambda contains return statements?
a) True
b) False


 Answer: b
Explanation: lambda definition does not include a return statement. it always contains an expression which is returned. Also note that we can put a lambda definition anywhere a function is expected. We don’t have to assign it to a variable at all. 



5. Lambda is a statement.
a) True
b) False


 Answer: b
Explanation: lambda is an anonymous function in Python. Hence this statement is false. 



6. Lambda contains block of statements.
a) True
b) False


 Answer: b
Explanation: None.

print z(8)

a) 432
b) 24000
c) 430
d) No output


 Answer: a
Explanation: None. 



(Python Function – 3) 8. What will be the output of the following Python code?

lamb = lambda x: x ** 3

a) Arthur Sir
b) Sir Arthur
c) Arthur
d) None of the mentioned


 Answer: b
Explanation: None. 



(Python Function – 3) 9. What will be the output of the following Python code?

print(lamb(5))

a)

 Answer: c
Explanation: None.




(Python Function – 3) 10. What will be the output of the following Python code?

def f(x, y, z): return x + y + z

a) 9997
b) 9999
c) 9996
d) None of the mentioned


 Answer:  c
Explanation: None.
