(Python While & For Loops – 1) 1. What will be the output of the following Python code?

x = ['ab', 'cd']
for i in x:
    i.upper()
print(x)

a) [‘ab’, ‘cd’] 
b) [‘AB’, ‘CD’] 
c) [None, None] 
d) none of the mentioned


Answer: a
Explanation: The function upper() does not modify a string in place, it returns a new string which isn’t being stored anywhere.



(Python While & For Loops – 1) 2. What will be the output of the following Python code?

x = ['ab', 'cd']
for i in x:
    x.append(i.upper())
print(x)

a) [‘AB’, ‘CD’] 
b) [‘ab’, ‘cd’, ‘AB’, ‘CD’] 
c) [‘ab’, ‘cd’] 
d) none of the mentioned


Answer: d
Explanation: The loop does not terminate as new elements are being added to the list in each iteration.



(Python While & For Loops – 1) 3. What will be the output of the following Python code?

while True:
    if i%3 == 0:
        break
    print(i)
 
    i + = 1

a) 1 2
b) 1 2 3
c) error
d) none of the mentioned


Answer: c
Explanation: SyntaxError, there shouldn’t be a space between + and = in +=.



(Python While & For Loops – 1) 4. What will be the output of the following Python code?

i = 1
while True:
    if i%0O7 == 0:
        break
    print(i)
    i += 1

a) 1 2 3 4 5 6
b) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
c) error
d) none of the mentioned


Answer: a
Explanation: Control exits the loop when i becomes 7.



(Python While & For Loops – 1) 5. What will be the output of the following Python code?

i = 5
while True:
    if i%0O11 == 0:
        break
    print(i)
    i += 1

a) 5 6 7 8 9 10
b) 5 6 7 8
c) 5 6
d) error


Answer: b
Explanation: 0O11 is an octal number.



(Python While & For Loops – 1) 6. What will be the output of the following Python code?

i = 5
while True:
    if i%0O9 == 0:
        break
    print(i)
    i += 1

a) 5 6 7 8
b) 5 6 7 8 9
c) 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ….
d) error


Answer: d
Explanation: 9 isn’t allowed in an octal number.



(Python While & For Loops – 1) 7. What will be the output of the following Python code?

i = 1
while True:
    if i%2 == 0:
        break
    print(i)
    i += 2

a) 1
b) 1 2
c) 1 2 3 4 5 6 …
d) 1 3 5 7 9 11 …


Answer: d
Explanation: The loop does not terminate since i is never an even number.



(Python While & For Loops – 1) 8. What will be the output of the following Python code?

i = 2
while True:
    if i%3 == 0:
        break
    print(i)
    i += 2

a) 2 4 6 8 10 …
b) 2 4
c) 2 3
d) error


Answer: b
Explanation: The numbers 2 and 4 are printed. The next value of i is 6 which is divisible by 3 and hence control exits the loop.



(Python While & For Loops – 1) 9. What will be the output of the following Python code?

i = 1
while False:
    if i%2 == 0:
        break
    print(i)
    i += 2

a) 1
b) 1 3 5 7 …
c) 1 2 3 4 …
d) none of the mentioned


Answer: d
Explanation: Control does not enter the loop because of False.
