(Python While & For Loops – 6) 7. What will be the output of the following Python code snippet?

a = [0, 1, 2, 3]
for a[-1] in a:
    print(a[-1])

a) 0 1 2 3
b) 0 1 2 2
c) 3 3 3 3
d) error


Answer: b
Explanation: The value of a[-1] changes in each iteration.



(Python While & For Loops – 6) 8. What will be the output of the following Python code snippet?

a = [0, 1, 2, 3]
for a[0] in a:
    print(a[0])

a) 0 1 2 3
b) 0 1 2 2
c) 3 3 3 3
d) error


Answer: a
Explanation: The value of a[0] changes in each iteration. Since the first value that it takes is itself, there is no visible error in the current example.

b) 0
c) error
d) none of the mentioned


Answer: c
Explanation: SyntaxError, not in isn’t allowed in for loops.
